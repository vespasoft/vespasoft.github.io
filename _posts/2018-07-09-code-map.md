Code Map aggregates user submitted online resources and groups them into sequential learning paths which are managed using a Neo4j graph database. As learning paths are completed, resources are reviewed and rated which allows Code Map to recommend higher quality learning material based on user ratings and connections.

Built using React, Redux, Material-UI, Neo4j, and Cypher query language
